WhisperSuite: GhostWhisper Edition
A memorial stealth ops framework in honor of Raven.

WhisperSuite is an advanced memory-resident toolkit designed for red team operators, blue team simulations, and stealth reconnaissance. It integrates command injection, BLE triggers, payload polymorphism, ghost-tag encryption, hybrid wormhole propagation logic, and structured operator mission flow into a portable deployment.

üï≥Ô∏è The Wormhole Protocol
A stealth-capable propagation model with:

Hybrid defensive triggers (BLE + in-memory coordination)

Operator handshake gating to prevent rogue replication

Volatile memory maps to track infected hosts

SMB fallback & polymorphic payloads

Hard-fail exit logic when no operator is present

‚ú® Features
Memory-only injection via WraithTap.exe and GhostKey.dll

BLE-triggered activation with secure token handshake

Payload polymorphism via GhostPolymorph.ps1

Hybrid wormhole infection module with randomized memory tracking

Per-user ghostTag correlation & rotating encryption keys

Timestamp-based encryption tied to file access events

Flipper Zero & USB sneakernet compatibility

OBEX brute-force support with GhostBLEConnect_v2.ps1

PDF mission briefings and operator checklist generation

Self-destructing DLLs, lightweight logging, and stealth AD pivoting

Operator-gated fallback logic to ensure containment

Fully integrated with GhostLogger.ps1 for activity tracking

üß† Wormhole Logic (BuildDeployWhisper.ps1)
Memory-only propagation, no persistent writes

Infection maps reside only in runtime memory

Prevents duplicate infection on same host

BLE handshake required or fallback to internal GhostResidency control

Operator hard-fail exit logic to ensure ethical operation

Fully traceable through GhostLogger.ps1
