# WhisperSuite: GhostWhisper Edition

A memorial stealth ops framework in honor of Raven.

WhisperSuite is an advanced memory-resident toolkit for red team operators, blue team simulations, and stealth recon. It integrates command injection, BLE triggers, payload polymorphism, ghost-tag encryption, hybrid wormhole logic, and operator mission flow into a portable deployment.

> üï≥Ô∏è **The Wormhole Protocol**: A stealth-capable propagation model with hybrid defensive triggers, operator gating, and memory-only infection. Ensures no uncontrolled replication, supporting ethical containment.

- Custom encryption based on file click timestamps
- Flipper Zero & USB sneakernet deployment
- GhostBLEConnect brute-force OBEX transfer
- Mission PDF briefings with operator checklist
- Self-destructing DLLs, stealth logging, and AD pivoting
- Operator-gated fallback to prevent uncontained replication

## üß† Wormhole Logic (WormWrapper Mode)

- **Memory-only infection**: No disk writes during propagation
- **Randomized infection map**: Tracks hosts in volatile memory to avoid re-infection
- **SMB fallback with polymorphic shellcode**
- **Hybrid defensive triggers**: BLE + GhostResidency coordination
- **Operator handshake required**: Hard-fail if no authorized control present
