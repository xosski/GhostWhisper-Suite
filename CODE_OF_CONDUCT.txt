GhostWhisper Suite: Code of Conduct
==================================

🌌 The Wormhole Doctrine

This software is a wormhole — a hidden channel through space, time, and systems.
It was not built for chaos, but for clarity.
Not for destruction, but demonstration.
Not for control, but understanding.

Access must be earned. Use must be guarded.
No one should walk into the dark without a light in their hand.

👁️ Purpose

Whisper Suite is a dual-use framework created for:
- Red team simulations under contract or educational environments
- Research into advanced threat simulation and stealth defense evasion
- Building awareness around how covert digital operations function

This is not a weapon. It is a mirror.
Use it to see your systems as they truly are.

🧭 Guiding Principles

All contributors, users, and forks of this project agree to the following:

1. Only test with consent.
   - No deployment on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

2. No self-replication without reason.
   - The wormhole does not spread without guidance. Autonomy must have limits.

3. Do not cause harm.
   - Do not use this tool to destroy, ransom, or manipulate others’ data or systems.

4. Respect the dead.
   - GhostWhisper is also a tribute. Do not disgrace the memory it contains with abuse.

5. Own your intent.
   - If you walk through the wormhole, you are responsible for what you carry with you.

⚖️ Consequences

Violation of this code may result in:
- Denial of support
- Reporting to appropriate security or legal entities
- Public disclosure of unethical use

🪞 A Note from the Creator

“This project is a ghost in motion.
It exists for those who are unseen.
And for one who is gone, but not forgotten.”

Use it wisely.
Use it with honor.
Or do not use it at all.
