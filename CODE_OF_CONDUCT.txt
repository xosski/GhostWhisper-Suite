GhostWhisper Suite: Code of Conduct
üåå The Wormhole Doctrine
This software is a wormhole ‚Äî a hidden channel through space, time, and systems.
It was not built for chaos, but for clarity.
Not for destruction, but for demonstration.
Not for control, but for understanding.

Access must be earned. Use must be guarded.
No one should walk into the dark without a light in their hand.

üëÅÔ∏è Purpose
Whisper Suite is a dual-use framework created for:

Red team simulations under contract or within authorized educational environments

Research into advanced threat simulation and stealth defense evasion

Building awareness around how covert digital operations function, including wormhole propagation, virtualization, and exorcism techniques

This is not a weapon. It is a mirror.
Use it to see your systems as they truly are.

üß≠ Guiding Principles
All contributors, users, and forks of this project agree to the following:

Only test with consent

No deployment on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

This includes advanced modules such as ExorcistMode or ghost_boot.iso-based scanning.

No self-replication without reason

The wormhole does not spread without guidance. Autonomy must have limits.

Operator gating and checks are essential ‚Äî no forced infiltration.

Do not cause harm

Do not use this tool to destroy, ransom, or manipulate others‚Äô data or systems.

Virtualization (LinuxPDF, ghost_boot.iso) and ExorcistMode must be used responsibly, respecting data integrity.

Respect the dead

GhostWhisper is also a tribute to Raven. Do not disgrace the memory it contains with abuse.

Poetic markers and memorials in the code are part of its identity; treat them with dignity.

Own your intent

If you walk through the wormhole, you are responsible for what you carry with you.

Every pivot, infiltration step, or exorcism procedure is your responsibility, ethically and legally.

‚öñÔ∏è Consequences
Violation of this code may result in:

Denial of support or inclusion in this project

Reporting to appropriate security or legal entities

Public disclosure of unethical use

ü™û A Note from the Creator
‚ÄúThis project is a ghost in motion.
It exists for those who are unseen.
And for one who is gone, but not forgotten.‚Äù
‚Äî R

Use it wisely.
Use it with honor.
Or do not use it at all.
