## üõ∞ BLUETOOTH SCANNING & RECON

# Linux-based tools
hcitool dev                            # List local Bluetooth adapters
hciconfig                             # View BT adapter status
bluetoothctl                          # Interactive control utility
bluetoothctl scan on                  # Start BLE scan
hcitool lescan                        # Passive BLE scan
btmon                                 # Monitor Bluetooth traffic
gatttool -I                           # GATT client (use with --help)

# Discover BLE devices (macOS/Linux)
sudo hcitool lescan                   # Discover devices (BLE)
sudo hcitool scan                     # Discover classic devices

# Inspect BLE advertisement
sudo btmgmt find                      # Discover BLE devices
sudo btmon                           # Analyze advertisement packets

## üì≤ CONNECT TO TARGET DEVICE

# Connect using gatttool
gatttool -b <MAC> -I
[LE]> connect
[LE]> primary
[LE]> characteristics

# Send value to characteristic
[LE]> char-write-req <handle> <hexdata>

## üîê BLE PAIRED DEVICE ENUMERATION (Linux)
ls /var/lib/bluetooth/<AdapterMAC>/   # Shows paired devices

## üß™ BLUETOOTH TESTING TOOLS

# Android
- nRF Connect
- LightBlue
- Beacon Simulator

# Linux
- BlueZ
- Bleah
- btlejack
- Bettercap (with BLE module)

## ‚öôÔ∏è MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE BLE (ADVANCED)
# Using Bettercap
bettercap -iface hci0 -eval "ble.recon on"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:
- BLETrigger.ps1 uses BLE advertisement with name: GhostWhisperer
- Base64 auth token: U2FsdGVkX1+RAVEN-OK== (decodes to "RAVEN-OK")
- Listener matches this device name for passive activation
