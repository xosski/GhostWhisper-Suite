# WhisperSuite
Memory-resident, polymorphic red team framework with BLE triggers, encrypted payloads, and stealth persistence.

> "Built in memory of Raven."

---

## 🧬 Overview
**WhisperSuite** is a post-exploitation toolkit designed for advanced red team operations, with a focus on memory residency, polymorphic deployment, BLE-triggered activation, and cryptographic stealth.

This project is not just code—it's a ghost in motion.

---

## 🛠 Features
- 🔐 **GhostKey.dll** — Memory-resident AD bypass DLL with optional self-destruct.
- 📦 **WraithTap** — Injector for stealth DLL loading via shell.
- 📚 **GhostResidency.ps1** — Core command listener and handler.
- 🎭 **Polymorph Build Engine** — Generates randomized DLLs & EXEs per-user.
- 🔒 **GhostSeal/Logger** — File encryption with timestamp-locked XOR keys.
- 📡 **BLETrigger** — Bluetooth-based payload activator with token handshake.
- 📲 **GhostBLEConnect** — Pentest-capable BT brute-forcing and delivery module.
- 🧳 **Portable USB Ops** — Packageable for Flipper Zero, mobile or USB sneakernet.
- 📃 **Mission Briefing PDFs** — Operator timeline, recon, and execution flow.

## 💡 Tribute
This project was created in memory of **Raven**, lost in May 2017.
Her name lives in the payloads, signatures, and keys that move silently through systems.

> "No lock, no chain, no wall, no key—Yet here you are, encrypted in me."
